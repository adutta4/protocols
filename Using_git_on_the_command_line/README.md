## Goal
This tutorial goes over the basics of using `git` on the command line to save, revise, and distribute code via a GitHub repository. Here we cover a simple use case of a single developer working from a single machine. Using `git` can also facilitate collaborative
software development, but we will cover that in a later tutorial.

## FAQ
**What is `git`?** `git` is an open-source command-line tool for software *version control*. Placing your code in a version-controlled repository allows you to roll back (and forward) your code so you can make revisions without fear of destroying functioning code you
may have already written.  
**What is GitHub?** GitHub is a cloud service for hosting `git` repositories, owned by Microsoft.
