Welcome to the chavez_lab/protocols!  

The goal of chavez_lab/protocols is to facilitate knowledge transfer in the Chavez lab. If you have perfected a protocol/workflow/tutorial and think a future lab member may benefit, consider contributing a protocol!

## Directory

Protocols which include code or multiple files live in the code repository, https://github.com/chavez-lab/protocols.  
Documents containing general info live in the wiki, https://github.com/chavez-lab/protocols/wiki. [^1]  

## Contributing

chavez_lab/protocols documentation is written in the markdown language. See the [markdown basic syntax guide](https://www.markdownguide.org/basic-syntax/) or use an existing page as a template to get started.  

### Best practices
- Protocols should not contain sensitive data (PHI, passwords, private keys, etc.) or large data files > 100kb.
- Each protocol should be housed in a subdirectory of the main repository. Give this subdirectory a descriptive name.
- All protocols should have a README.md document.
- If your protocol has dependencies or other requirements, include these sections in your README.md. Ideally, include a machine-readable file so that others can easily reproduce your environment. 

## Footnotes
[^1]: We're trying out the GH wiki feature, but there's a strong argument that the wiki is redundant with just making a new markdown document in the code repository. So far, the major benefit of the wiki is that it comes with an expandable table of contents. The major disadvantage is that footnotes like this one are not correctly formatted in a Github wiki.
